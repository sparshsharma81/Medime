NOW WE ARE BUILDING A DOCTOR APPOINTMENT PROJECT 
HERE THE CUSTOMER CAN BOOK A APPONTMENT FROM THE DOCTOR AVAILABLILITY

I AM BUILDING THIS PROJECT USING NEXT-JS AND SHADCN UI 

NEXT JS IS SIMILAR TO REACT --- BUT IT CAN BE USED FOR BOTH FRONTEND AND BACKNED 
AND SHADCN UI OFFER PREDEFINED BUILD IN COMPONENTS 


first we just write npx-create-app@latest --- this will initilze a empty next js app 

in order to run a npx app --- npm run dev 

we will be using shadcn ui--- which has many predefined build in COMPONENTS 
so basically we need not to put so much mechanical effort and build our components 
--which we can copy paste in our app 

so in order to use the shadcn ui --- we need to first install it 
we can do it with 

npx shadcn@latest init    -----THIS IS THE WAY OF INSTALLING SHADCN UI 

and if we want to use a component ..let us say button 
then we can use it with 

npx shadcn@latest add button     ----THIS WAY..WE CAN INSTALL THE BUTTON AND USE IT 



so in order to install any component..we can simply use npx -shadcn@latest add componet_name     ----USING THIS..WE CAN INSTALL ANY COMPONENT USING SHADCN 

now after we have installed the button...we will be using the dark mode themes 
so for that ...


npx install next-themes 



now after adding them...now we are adding 
npx shadcn@latest add alert badge card dialog input label select separator sonner tabs textarea
